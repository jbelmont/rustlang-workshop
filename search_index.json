Library\nError Handling\nGenerics\nLifetimes\nTesting\n\nInstalling Rust\nTo install Rust in Linux and Mac OS X run the following command:\ncurl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n\nFor other installation methods please read the following documentation\nAdd the cargo binaries to your path by adding the following entry in ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile:\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH\"\n\nInstalling Rust in Windows\nOn Windows, go to install and follow the instructions for installing Rust. \nYou will need to install C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later here but it is best to just install Visual Studio Build Tools\nThe tools are in the Other Tools and Frameworks section which looks like this:\n\nCheck Rust Installation\nIf Rust is installed then you should be able to run the following command in your terminal windows:\nrustc --version\nrustc 1.26.2 (594fb253c 2018-06-01)\n\nUpdating Rustlang\nIn order to update the rust binaries you need to run the following command:\nrustup update\n\nNow when we run the --version options with rustc a new version should be reported if the update found a new version:\nrustc --version\nrustc 1.28.0 (9634041f0 2018-07-30)\n\nViewing Local Documentation\nIn order to see local documentation you can run the following command:\nrustup doc\n\nCargo Package Manager\nRust comes with a powerful package manager called cargo.\nYou can create new rust packages by using the cargo package manager.\nThe command you use is: cargo new with options and provide a name\nCreate a new binary template package\nIf you want to create a new rust binary template application then run the following command:\ncargo new PACKAGE_NAME --bin\n\nCreate a new library template package\nIf you want to create a new rust library template application then run the following command:\ncargo new PACKAGE_NAME --lib\n\nThe contents of a new binary template package\nWhen you create a new binary application cargo will create the following files:\n\nNotice that the following files were created:\n\nCargo.lock\nThis file locks your dependencies\n\n\nCargo.toml\nThis file will have basic metadata for the rust package and dependencies\n\n\nsrc directory\nmain.rs\nThis will be main program for the application\n\n\n\n\n\nContents of Cargo.toml:\n[package]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"Jean-Marcel Belmont \"]\n\n[dependencies]\n\nContents of src/main.rs:\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n\nBuild Rust package\nIn order to build the rust package you can run the following command:\n\nThis command generates the target directory with the following content:\n\nRunning Rust package\nYou could run rust packages by issuing the following command:\ncargo run\n\nThis will build and run the rust package.\nCheck the Rust package for build issues\nYou can use the cargo check command to see if your package will build but it will not create an executable.\nRunning individual cargo packages\nYou can run individual cargo packages like this:\ncargo run -p strings\n\nThis will run the strings cargo package only\nYou should probably try to run cargo build before doing this in your system.\nRunning individual tests with cargo\nYou can run individual cargo tests in a particular package by doing the following:\ncargo test -p testing\n\nThis will only run tests in the testing cargo package.\n"},"docs/hello_world.html":{"url":"docs/hello_world.html","title":"Hello World","keywords":"","body":"Rust Workshop - Hello

Workshop - Variables\nSections:\n\nVariables\nLexical Scope\nImmutable variables\nMutable variables\nConstants\n\n\nvariables\">Practice Exercise -> Variables\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nvariables\nVariables in rust are much like variables in other programming languages.\nLexical Scope\nVariables will have lexical scope based on where the variable is defined so for example if you define a variable in an if block in rustlang then that variable will only have scope within that if block while a variable defined at the top of a function will have scope anywhere while it is in that respective function.\nImmutable variables\nIn rust unless you preface a variable with the mut it is considered immutable so you cannot reassign a variable.\nFor example:\nlet a = 3;\n\na = 4;\n\nThis will throw a compiler error like this:\nerror[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable a\n --> src/main.rs:3:5\n  |\n2 |     let a = 3;\n  |         -\n  |         |\n  |         first assignment to a\n  |         help: make this binding mutable: mut a\n3 |     a = 4;\n  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable\nCompiler error for immutable variable\nMutable variables\nIf you want to make a variable mutable then you need to use the mut keyword so if we rewrote the program like this:\nlet mut a = 3;\na = 4;\n\nThen we will not get error like we did before.\nConstants\n\nA constant item is an optionally named constant value which is not associated with a specific memory location in the program. Constants are essentially inlined wherever they are used, meaning that they are copied directly into the relevant context when used. References to the same constant are not necessarily guaranteed to refer to the same memory address.\n\nconstants items specification\nconst playground link\nfn main() {\n    const num: i32 = 5;\n    num = 6;\n}\n\nconstant wikipedia\n\nIn computer programming, a constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant. When associated with an identifier, a constant is said to be \"named,\" although the terms \"constant\" and \"named constant\" are often used interchangeably. This is contrasted with a variable, which is an identifier with a value that can be changed during normal execution, i.e., the value is variable. Constants are useful for both programmers and compilers: For programmers they are a form of self-documenting code and allow reasoning about correctness, while for compilers they allow compile-time and run-time checks that verify that constancy assumptions are not violated, and allow or simplify some compiler optimizations.\n\nPractice Exercise -> Variables\nPractice Exercise -> Variables\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Hello World\nData Streams →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/stdin-stdout-stderr.html":{"url":"docs/stdin-stdout-stderr.html","title":"Data Streams","keywords":"","body":"Rust Workshop - Data Streams - stdin, stdout, stderr\nSections:\n\nFormatting strings and printing\nformat!\nprint!\nprintln!\neprint!\neprintln!\npositional arguments\ntext alignment\ndata-streams\">Practice Exercise -> Data Streams\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nFormatting strings and printing\nFormatting strings is a common occurrence when dealing with characters and strings in programming.\nIf you are creating a script in the command line then you might want to add some padding and justify text.\nYou can do this with rust by using some of the macros defined in the std::fmt:\n\nformat!\n\nCreates a String using interpolation of runtime expressions.\nwrite formatted text to String\n\n\nprint!\n\nemits output to stdout (console) io:stdiou\n\n\nprintln!\n\nsame as print! but a newline is appended.\n\n\neprint!\n\nThe eprint! macro is identical to print! and println! except eprint! emits its output to standard error.\n\n\neprintln!\n\nsame as eprint! but a newline is appended.\n\n\n\nformat! macro\nformat! playground link\nfn main() {\n    let language = \"rust\";\n    let workshop = \"workshop\";\n\n    let out = format!(\"{} {} {}\", String::from(\"hello\"), language, workshop);\n    println!(\"{}\", out);\n}\n\nprint! macro\nprint! playground link\nprintln! macro\nprintln! playground link\neprint! macro\neprint! playground link\neprintln! macro\neprintln! playground link\npositional arguments\nYou can use positional arguments in the std::fmt module\nPositional parameters\n\nEach formatting argument is allowed to specify which value argument it's referencing, and if omitted it is assumed to be \"the next argument\".

The form of an if expression is a condition expression, followed by a consequent block, any number of else if conditions and blocks, and an optional trailing else block. The condition expressions must have type bool. If a condition expression evaluates to true, the consequent block is executed and any subsequent else if or else block is skipped. If a condition expression evaluates to false, the consequent block is skipped and any subsequent else if condition is evaluated. If all if and else if conditions evaluate to false then any else block is executed. An if expression evaluates to the same value as the executed block, or () if no block is evaluated. An if expression must have the same type in all situations.\n\nRust has control structures as you may have seen them in other programming languages.\nYou will not see parenthesis typically in the ifcontrol structures however.\nfn main() {\n    let x = 10;\n    if x > 0 {\n        println!(\"in here\");\n    } else if x \nif let expression\nif let specification\n\nAn if let expression is semantically similar to an if expression but in place of a condition expression it expects the keyword let followed by a pattern, an = and a scrutinee expression. If the value of the scrutinee matches the pattern, the corresponding block will execute. Otherwise, flow proceeds to the following else block if it exists. Like if expressions, if let expressions have a value determined by the block that is evaluated.\n\nif let example\nfn main() {\n    let num = Some(5);\n\n    let matchedNone: Option = None;\n\n    if let Some(x) = num {\n        println!(\"Matched {:?}\", x)\n    }\n\n    if let Some(x) = matchedNone {\n        println!(\"Matched {:?}\", x);\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Didn't match anything\")\n    }\n}\n\nWhen you run this example you get: \nMatched 5\nDidn\\'t match anything\n\nif let playground link\nmatch expression\nmatch specification\n\nA match expression branches on a pattern. The exact form of matching that occurs depends on the pattern. A match expression has a scrutinee expression, which is the value to compare to the patterns. The scrutinee expression and the patterns must have the same type.\n\nmatch is somewhat similar to switch statement like other programming languages.\nmatch example\nfn main() {\n    let num = 7;\n\n    match num {\n        1 => println!(\"matched 1\"),\n        2 | 3 | 5 => println!(\"matched prime\"),\n        2 ... 7 => println!(\"matched 2,3,4,5,6,7\"),\n        _ => println!(\"Didn't match something\"),\n    }\n\n    let boolean = false;\n\n    let switch = match boolean {\n        true => 1,\n        false => 0,\n    };\n\n    println!(\"{} -> {}\", boolean, switch);\n}\n\nloop expression\nloop expression specification\n\nA loop expression repeats execution of its body continuously: loop { println!(\"I live.\"); }.\nA loop expression without an associated break expression is diverging and has type !. A loop expression containing associated break expression(s) may terminate, and must have type compatible with the value of the break expression(s).\n\nloop example\nfn main() {\n    loop {\n        println!(\"Hello People!\");\n    }\n}\n\nThis will continuously print \"Hello People!\" to standard output since there is no terminating condition or break expression.\nwhile expression\nwhile expression specification\n\nA while loop begins by evaluating the boolean loop conditional expression. If the loop conditional expression evaluates to true, the loop body block executes, then control returns to the loop conditional expression. If the loop conditional expression evaluates to false, the while expression completes.\n\nwhile example\nfn main() {\n    let mut number: i32 = 0;\n\n    let mut sum: i32 = 0;\n    while number \nwhile example playground\nwhile let expression\nwhile let specification\n\nA while let loop is semantically similar to a while loop but in place of a condition expression it expects the keyword let followed by a pattern, an =, a scrutinee expression and a block expression. If the value of the scrutinee matches the pattern, the loop body block executes then control returns to the pattern matching statement. Otherwise, the while expression completes.\n\nwhile let example\nfn main() {\n    let mut primes = vec![3, 5, 7];\n\n    while let Some(y) = primes.pop() {\n        println!(\"y = {}\", y);\n    }\n}\n\nwhile let playground\nfor expression\nfor expression specification\n\nA for expression is a syntactic construct for looping over elements provided by an implementation of std::iter::IntoIterator. If the iterator yields a value, that value is matched against the irrefutable pattern, the body of the loop is executed, and then control returns to the head of the for loop. If the iterator is empty, the for expression completes.\n\nfor example\nfn main() {\n    let numbers = vec![3, 5, 7];\n\n    let mut multiplied_numbers = Vec::new();\n    for prime in numbers {\n        multiplied_numbers.push(prime * 5);\n    }\n\n    println!(\"{:?}\", multiplied_numbers);\n\n    assert_eq!(multiplied_numbers[0], 15);\n}\n\nfor example playground\nbreak expression\nbreak expression specification\n\nWhen break is encountered, execution of the associated loop body is immediately terminated\nA break expression is normally associated with the innermost loop, for or while loop enclosing the break expression, but a label can be used to specify which enclosing loop is affected.\n\nbreak example\nfn main() {\n    let phrases = vec![\"Here\", \"I\", \"Am\"];\n\n    for phrase in phrases {\n        if phrase == \"I\" {\n            break;\n        } else {\n            println!(\"{}\", phrase);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nbreak example playground\ncontinue expression\ncontinue expression specification\n\nWhen continue is encountered, the current iteration of the associated loop body is immediately terminated, returning control to the loop head. In the case of a while loop, the head is the conditional expression controlling the loop. In the case of a for loop, the head is the call-expression controlling the loop.\nLike break, continue is normally associated with the innermost enclosing loop, but continue 'label may be used to specify the loop affected. A continue expression is only permitted in the body of a loop.\n\ncontinue example\nfn main() {\n    let numbers = vec![3, 5 , 7, 11];\n\n    for num in numbers {\n        if num == 7 {\n            continue\n        }\n        println!(\"{}\", num);\n    }\n}\n\ncontinue example playground\nlabel expression\nlabel expression specification\n\nA loop expression may optionally have a label. The label is written as a lifetime preceding the loop expression, as in 'foo: loop { break 'foo; }, 'bar: while false {}, 'humbug: for _ in 0..0 {}. If a label is present, then labeled break and continue expressions nested within this loop may exit out of this loop or return control to its head. See break expressions and continue expressions.\n\nlabel example\nfn main() {\n    let numbers = vec![1, 3, 5];\n    'outer: loop {\n        for num in &numbers {\n            if *num == 3 {\n                break 'outer;   \n            }\n            println!(\"{}\", *num * 5);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlabel example playground\nPractice Exercise -> Control Flow\nPractice Exercise -> Control Flow\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n←  Data Streams\nFunctions →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/functions.html":{"url":"docs/functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Rust Workshop - Functions\nSections:\n\nFunctions Playground\nFunction Rust Specification\nRecursion\nMultiple Return Types\nconst functions\nfunctions\">Practice Exercise -> Functions\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nFunctions Playground\nPlayground\nFunction Rust Specification\nFunction Rust Specification\n\nA function lets us wrap up a sequence of statements as a unit that can be called from elsewhere in a program\n\nSometimes a function is reused repeatedly in order to promote dry code\n\n\nTo declare a function in rust you use the fn keyword\n\nFunctions may declare a set of input variables as parameters, through which the caller passes arguments into the function, and the output type of the value the function will return to its caller on completion.\n\nExample Rust Function\nfn multiplier(x: i32, multiplier: i32) -> i32 {\n    x * multiplier\n}\n\nRecursion\nFunctions may be recursive, that is, they may call themselves, either directly or indirectly.\nfn fibonacci(number: i32) -> i32 {\n    if number \nThe example above is called the Fibonacci sequence and we are using recursion in rust.\nBe warned though that Rust does not support Tail Call Recursion.\nMultiple Return Types\nFunctions in Rust can return multiple values, it is done with tuples.\nfn compute(x: i32, multiplier: i32) -> (i32, i32) {\n    (x * multiplier, x + multiplier)\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn should_compute() {\n    let (x, y) = compute(2, 3);\n    assert!(x == 6 && y == 5);\n}\n\nNotice that we had to put parenthesis around the assignment in the compute function call since we returned a tuple.\nconst functions\nconst functions specification\n\nFunctions qualified with the const keyword are const functions. Const functions can be called from within const contexts. When called from a const context, the function is interpreted by the compiler at compile time.

Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order matters. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first n natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length n).\n\nComputing Definition\n\nIn computer science, finite sequences are called lists. Potentially infinite sequences are called streams. Finite sequences of characters or digits are called strings.\n\nTuple\nTuple Specification\n\nA tuple type is a heterogeneous product of other types, called the elements of the tuple.

In either case, fields may be given in any order in a corresponding struct expression; the resulting struct value will always have the same memory layout.\n\nfn main() {\n    struct Soldier {\n        name: &'a str,\n        rank: &'b str,\n        experience: u32,\n    }\n\n    let rambo = Soldier {\n        name: \"John Rambo\",\n        rank: \"SFC\",\n        experience: 12,\n    };\n\n    assert_eq!(rambo.name, \"John Rambo\");\n    assert_eq!(rambo.rank, \"SFC\");\n    assert_eq!(rambo.experience, 12);\n}\n\nStruct types playground\nEnum\nEnumerated Types specification\n\nAn enumerated type is a nominal, heterogeneous disjoint union type, denoted by the name of an enum item.\nAn enum item declares both the type and a number of variants, each of which is independently named and has the syntax of a struct, tuple struct or unit-like struct.\nNew instances of an enum can be constructed in an enumeration variant expression.\n\nfn main() {\n    enum Army {\n        Soldier {\n            identifier: char\n        }\n    }\n    let soldier = Army::Soldier {\n        identifier: 'v',\n    };\n\n    let ch = match soldier {\n       Army::Soldier { identifier: 'v' } => \"matched v\",\n       _ => \"not matched\"\n    };\n    assert_eq!(ch, \"matched v\");\n}\n\nEnum playground\nUnion\nUnion specification\n\nA union declaration uses the same syntax as a struct declaration, except with union in place of struct.\nThe key property of unions is that all fields of a union share common storage. As a result writes to one field of a union can overwrite its other fields, and size of a union is determined by the size of its largest field.\n\nfn main() {\n    union Soldier {\n        age: u32,\n    }\n\n    let rambo = Soldier {\n        age: 32,\n    };\n    assert_eq!(unsafe {rambo.age}, 32);\n}\n\nNotice that I had to wrap read to the age field in unsafe blocks.\nerror[E0133]: access to union field is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block\nUnion playground\nFunction Types\nFunction Item Types\nFunction Item specification\n\nWhen referred to, a function item, or the constructor of a tuple-like struct or enum variant, yields a zero-sized value of its function item type. That type explicitly identifies the function - its name, its type arguments, and its early-bound lifetime arguments (but not its late-bound lifetime arguments, which are only assigned when the function is called) - so the value does not need to contain an actual function pointer, and no indirection is needed when the function is called.\n\nfn main() {\n   fn calculation () {\n       println!(\"2 + 2 is {}\", 2 + 2)\n   }\n\n   calculation::();\n}\n\nClosure types\nClosure types specification\n\nA closure expression produces a closure value with a unique, anonymous type that cannot be written out. A closure type is approximately equivalent to a struct which contains the captured variables. For instance, the following closure:\n\nfn main() {\n    let compute = |numbers: std::vec::Vec| {\n        numbers\n        .iter()\n        .fold(0, |sum, val| sum + val) / numbers.len() as u32\n    };\n\n    println!(\"{}\", compute(vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));\n}\n\nClosures playground\nPointer Types\nPointer Wikipedia Definition\n\nIn computer science, a pointer is a programming language object that stores the memory address of another value located in computer memory. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on that page. The actual format and content of a pointer variable is dependent on the underlying computer architecture.\n\nPointer Types specification\n\nAll pointers in Rust are explicit first-class values. They can be moved or copied, stored into data structs, and returned from functions.\n\nReferences\nReferences specification\n\nThese point to memory owned by some other value. When a shared reference to a value is created it prevents direct mutation of the value. Interior mutability provides an exception for this in certain circumstances. As the name suggests, any number of shared references to a value may exist. A shared reference type is written &type, or &'a type when you need to specify an explicit lifetime. Copying a reference is a \"shallow\" operation: it involves only copying the pointer itself, that is, pointers are Copy. Releasing a reference has no effect on the value it points to, but referencing of a temporary value will keep it alive during the scope of the reference itself.\n\nRaw Pointer\nRaw Pointer specification\n\nRaw pointers are pointers without safety or liveness guarantees. Raw pointers are written as const T or mut T, for example const i32 means a raw pointer to a 32-bit integer. Copying or dropping a raw pointer has no effect on the lifecycle of any other value. Dereferencing a raw pointer is an unsafe operation, this can also be used to convert a raw pointer to a reference by reborrowing it (& or &mut *). Raw pointers are generally discouraged in Rust code; they exist to support interoperability with foreign code, and writing performance-critical or low-level functions.\n\nNote that the Rust specification explicitly mentions that Raw Pointers are discouraged in Rust so take heed.\nA lot of this is due to the inherent security flaw that occurs when you deallocate pointers when the memory address isn't correct.\nHere is a good stack overflow post on the dangers of pointers\nfn main() {\n    let number = 15;\n\n    let raw_pointer = &number as *const i32;\n\n    let mut num_mut = 25;\n\n    let raw_mut = &mut num_mut as *mut i32;\n\n    println!(\n        \"number = {}\\nraw_pointer = {:?}\\nnum_mut = {}\\nraw_mut = {:?}\",\n        number,\n        raw_pointer,\n        num_mut,\n        raw_mut,\n    );\n\n    let number2: u32 = 5;\n    let raw = &number2 as *const u32;\n    println!(\"{:?}\", raw);\n}\n\nRaw Pointer playground\nFunction Pointers\nFunction pointer types specification\n\nFunction pointer types, written using the fn keyword, refer to a function whose identity is not necessarily known at compile-time. They can be created via a coercion from both function items and non-capturing closures.\n\nfn main() {\n    fn sum(numbers: &[i32]) -> i32 {\n        let mut sum = 0;\n        for n in numbers.iter() {\n            sum += n;\n        }\n        sum\n    }\n\n    let mut summation = sum(&[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n    assert_eq!(summation, 15);\n    type MathOp = fn(&[i32]) -> i32;\n    let math: MathOp = sum;\n    summation = math(&[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);\n    println!(\"{}\", summation);\n}\n\nFunction pointers playground\nTrait Types\nTrait Types\n\nA trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type: Self. They can access other methods declared in the same trait.\nTraits can be implemented for any data type. In the example below, we define Animal, a group of methods. The Animal trait is then implemented for the Sheep data type, allowing the use of methods from Animal with a Sheep.\n\nTrait Objects\nTrait Objects specification\n\nA trait object is an opaque value of another type that implements a set of traits. The set of traits is made up of an object safe base trait plus any number of auto traits.\nTrait objects implement the base trait, its auto traits, and any supertraits of the base trait.\n\ntrait Soldier {\n    fn abilities(&self) -> String;\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Grunt {\n    rank: &'static str,\n    age: u32,\n    name: &'static str,\n    skill: [String; 4],\n}\n\nimpl Soldier for Grunt {\n    fn abilities(&self) -> String {\n        format!(\n            \"Rank is {}\\nAge is {}\\nName is {}\\nSkill is {:?}\",\n            self.rank,\n            self.age,\n            self.name,\n            self.skill,\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let rambo = Grunt {\n      rank: \"SFC\",\n      age: 32,\n      name: \"John Rambo\",\n      skill: [\n        String::from(\"Helicopter Pilot\"), \n        String::from(\"Expert Weapons Knowledge\"), \n        String::from(\"Hand to hand combat\"), \n        String::from(\"Extreme Survival\")\n      ],\n    };\n\n    println!(\"{:?}\", rambo.abilities());\n}\n\nTrait Objects playground\nImpl trait\nImpl trait specification\n\nFunctions can declare an argument to be an anonymous type parameter where the callee must provide a type that has the bounds declared by the anonymous type parameter and the function can only use the methods available by the trait bounds of the anonymous type parameter.\n\nfn average(numbers: &'n Vec) -> impl Iterator + 'n {\n    numbers\n        .iter()\n        .map(|x| x * 3)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    let expect_numbers = vec![3, 6, 9, 12, 15];\n    let mut counter = 0;\n    for n in average(&numbers) {\n        assert_eq!(n, expect_numbers[counter]);\n        counter += 1;\n    }\n}\n\nImpl trait playground\nPractice Exercise -> Data Types\nPractice Exercise -> Data Types\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Functions\nComments →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/comments.html":{"url":"docs/comments.html","title":"Comments","keywords":"","body":"Rust Workshop - Comments\nSections:\n\nComments overview\nLine Comment\nBlock Comment\nInner Line Document\nInner Block Document\nOuter Line Document\nOuter Block Document\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nComments overview\nA comment in computer programming is where the programmer explains or annotates source code for other humans to read.\nThey are meant to help explain source code for others to gain better understanding of the code.\nComments can also be used as documentation generators much like JavaDoc comments are used to generate documentation for Java programs.\nLine Comment\nRust uses the same type of syntax of C/C++ of line comments such as\n// The data type of number should be i32 here I believe\nlet number = 5;\n\nBlock Comment\nRust also uses block level comments like C/C++ comments such as\n/* Some Documentation on \n * crazyFunc function\n * \n */\nfn crazyFunc() {}\n\nInner Line Document\nAn inner line document in rust are usually used for documentation generation purposes and look like this:\n//!

This allows a compact syntax with less duplication.\n\nstruct Soldier {\n    name: String,\n    age: u32,\n    rank: String,\n    years_of_service: u32,\n}\n\nlet name = String::from(\"John Rambo\");\nlet age = 32;\nlet rank = String::from(\"SFC\");\nlet years_of_service = 12;\n\nlet rambo = Soldier {\n    name: name,\n    age: age,\n    rank: rank,\n    years_of_service: years_of_service,\n};\n\nlet rambo2 = Soldier {\n    name,\n    age,\n    rank,\n    years_of_service,\n};\n\nNotice that didn't add the value in rambo2 as it is the same name as the key.\nStruct Playground\nPlayground 1\nPlayground 2\nPlayground 3\nPractice Exercise -> Structs\nPractice Exercise -> Structs\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Slices\nMethods →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/methods.html":{"url":"docs/methods.html","title":"Methods","keywords":"","body":"Rust Workshop - Methods\nSections:\n\nMethod definition\nMethod example\nDifference between method and associated function\nMethod Playground\nmethods\">Practice Exercise -> Methods\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nMethod definition\nMethods are like functions in that they are declared using the fn keyword and can return values like functions.\nMethods are different in that they are defined within the context of a struct, enum, or trait object.\nA method always has self as the first parameter of its definition.\nMethod example\nstruct Soldier{\n    name: String,\n    age: u32,\n    rank: String,\n    years_of_service: u32,\n}\n\nimpl Soldier {\n    fn message(&self) -> String {\n        format!(\n            \"Name: {},\\nAge: {},\\nRank: {},\\nYears of Service: {}\",\n            self.name,\n            self.age,\n            self.rank,\n            self.years_of_service,\n        )\n    }\n\n    // fictious pay amount\n    fn basic_pay_rate(&self) -> u32 {\n        self.years_of_service * 4000\n    }\n\n    fn new(name: String, age: u32, rank: String, years_of_service: u32) -> Soldier {\n        Soldier {\n            name,\n            age,\n            rank,\n            years_of_service,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nDifference between method and associated function\nNotice that in the example above we defined a couple of methods and an associated function.\nAssociated methods are called using the :: syntax and notice that we didn't use the . operator to call new method.\nMethod Playground\nPlayground\nPractice Exercise -> Methods\nPractice Exercise -> Methods\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Structs\nEnums →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/enums.html":{"url":"docs/enums.html","title":"Enums","keywords":"","body":"Rust Workshop - Enums\nSections:\n\nEnum definition\nEnum example\nMatch expression\nif let expression\nEnum playground\nenum\">Practice Exercise -> Enum\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nEnum definition\nEnumerated Type specification\n\nAn enumeration, also referred to as enum is a simultaneous definition of a nominal enumerated type as well as a set of constructors, that can be used to create or pattern-match values of the corresponding enumerated type.\nEnumerations are declared with the keyword enum.\n\nEnum example\nenum Dance {\n    Tango(String),\n    Salsa(String),\n    Meringue(String),\n}\n\nimpl Dance {\n    fn phrase(&self) {\n        match self {\n            Dance::Tango(c) => println!(\"{}: Time to Tango\", c),\n            Dance::Salsa(c) => println!(\"{}: Salsa time\", c),\n            Dance::Meringue(c) => println!(\"{}: Not your average meringue\", c),\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn new_tango() -> Dance {\n        Dance::Tango(String::from(\"New Tango\"))\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that enumerations can also have methods defined on them and in this case the phrase for a particular dance is defined.\nMatch Expression\nMatch expression specification\n\nA match expression branches on a pattern. The exact form of matching that occurs depends on the pattern. A match expression has a scrutinee expression, which is the value to compare to the patterns. The scrutinee expression and the patterns must have the same type.\n\nMatch expressions are useful with enums as you can match on the enumerated items.\nNotice that in our earlier example we matched against Dance::Tango, etc using the match operator and then a statement is logged to standard output if a match evaluates to true.\nif let expression\nif let specification\n\nAn if let expression is semantically similar to an if expression but in place of a condition expression it expects the keyword let followed by a pattern, an = and a scrutinee expression. If the value of the scrutinee matches the pattern, the corresponding block will execute. Otherwise, flow proceeds to the following else block if it exists. Like if expressions, if let expressions have a value determined by the block that is evaluated.\n\nIf you look at the enum playground link you will see that I used an if let expression to unwrap the string value. \nEnum playground\nPlayground\nPractice Exercise -> Enum\nPractice Exercise -> Enum\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Methods\nPatterns →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/patterns.html":{"url":"docs/patterns.html","title":"Patterns","keywords":"","body":"Rust Workshop - Patterns\nSections:\n\nDifferent Pattern Types in Rust\nmatch args\nif let\nwhile let\nfor loop\nlet statement\nfunction parameter pattern\npatterns\">Practice Exercise -> Patterns\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nDifferent Pattern Types in Rust\nPatterns can be used in each of the following areas in Rust:\n\nmatch args\n\nif let\n\nwhile let\n\nfor loop\n\nlet statement\n\nfunction parameter\n\n\nmatch args\nWe covered the match statement earlier in the enum section of the workshop.\nmatch arms are a powerful pattern matching concept in rust but they can be used in more circumstances than just enums they can be used with numbers and in different manners.\nmatch arm with number\nlet number: u32 = 9;\n\nlet computation: u32 = 1;\nlet number = match number {\n    1 => computation * 2,\n    2 | 3 => computation * 2 * 3,\n    3 ..= 7 => computation * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7,\n    n @ 8 ..= 9 => computation * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * n,\n    _ => 0,\n};\n// 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 9 => 45360\nassert_eq!(number, 45360);\n\nNotice that we assigned number a value from the match expresssion evaluation\nmatch arm playground\nif let\nif let specification\nif let is a useful pattern when using match expressions can be clunky/awkward.\nIt looks cleaner and will do the pattern match we are looking for.\nenum Animal {\n    Dog(String),\n    Cat(String),\n}\n\nimpl Animal {\n    fn speak(&self) -> String {\n        match self {\n            Animal::Dog(d) => format!(\"Dog says: {}\", d),\n            Animal::Cat(c) => format!(\"Cat says: {}\", c),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let dog = Animal::Dog(String::from(\"arf arf growl!\"));\n    let cat = Animal::Cat(String::from(\"meow meow purr!\"));\n\n    assert_eq!(dog.speak(), String::from(\"Dog says: arf arf growl!\"));\n\n    if let Animal::Cat(c) = cat {\n        assert_eq!(c, \"meow meow purr!\");\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that in the code example above we used if let to match the Animal::Cat(String) enum.\nif let playground\nwhile let\nThe while let pattern is another pattern matching expression we can use with rust.\nIt can nicely replace patterns with match arms that are unwieldy.\nA while let loop will run as long as the condition is true.\nfn main() {\n    let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];\n\n    let mut value = 9;\n    while let Some(top) = numbers.pop() {\n        assert_eq!(top, value);\n        value -= 1;\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example the numbers vector has 9 values and each value is popped off the stack so when it gets to the last value of 1 it will cease being true and the expression will no longer be true.\nThe pop method has the following signature:\npub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option {\n    if self.len == 0 {\n        None\n    } else {\n        unsafe {\n            self.len -= 1;\n            Some(ptr::read(self.get_unchecked(self.len())))\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that it returns an Option type and it uses the  which will discuss later in the workshop.\nWhen the length is equal 0 it returns None\nwhile let playground\nfor loop\nThe for loop can also take a pattern that is evaluated.\nfn main() {\n    let chars = vec!['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];\n\n    let mut counter = 0;\n    for (index, ch) in chars.iter().enumerate() {\n        match ch {\n            'a' => assert_eq!(*ch, 'a'),\n            'b' => assert_eq!(*ch, 'b'),\n            'c' => assert_eq!(*ch, 'c'),\n            'd' => assert_eq!(*ch, 'd'),\n            'e' => assert_eq!(*ch, 'e'),\n            _ => (),\n        }\n        assert_eq!(index, counter);\n        counter += 1;\n    }\n}\n\nfor pattern playground\nlet statement\nThe let statement itself is a pattern that matches an expression evaluation\nlet num = 5;\n\nThis evaluates the primitive i32 value and assigns the value 5.\nlet PATTERN = EXPRESSION;\n\nWe can assign tuple values and use destructuring in the let evaluation\nfn main() {\n    struct Ballerina {\n        name: String,\n        age: u32,\n    }\n\n    let anna = Ballerina {\n        name: String::from(\"Anna Person\"),\n        age: 21,\n    };\n\n    let (name, age) = (anna.name, anna.age);\n\n    assert_eq!(name, \"Anna Person\");\n    assert_eq!(age, 21);\n}\n\nNotice that in this code example we instantiated a Ballerina struct value and assigned a tuple value using let statement.\nlet statement playground\nfunction parameter pattern\nfunctions in rust can also be pattern themselves;

This also goes hand in hand with the principle of least privilege.\nA module should only be able to access the {structs,constants,functions,enums,modules} that are necessary for its intended purpose.\nWhen we use the pub keyword we modify {structs,constants,functions,enums,modules} for usage outside of the module in which they are defined and therefore can be used in other modules that there were not defined in.\nLet us look at an example to better explain this concept:\n// src/species.rs\nmod animal {\n    fn traits() {}\n}\n\n// src/person.rs\nmod human {\n    fn traits() {}\n}\n\nIf we were to try to access animal::traits() in the human module we would get a compile time error since animal is a private module and its function traits is private as well.\nIf we were to change its visibility to public using the pub keyword we could access it on the person module.\n// src/species.rs\npub mod animal {\n    pub fn traits() {}\n}\n\n// src/person.rs\nmod human {\n    fn traits() {}\n}\n\nNotice that we used the pub keyword in the mod keyword and in the fn in order to call the traits function that lives in the animal module\nModule Tree\nmodules specification\n\nA module is a container for zero or more items.\nA module item is a module, surrounded in braces, named, and prefixed with the keyword mod. A module item introduces a new, named module into the tree of modules making up a crate. Modules can nest arbitrarily.\nModules and types share the same namespace. Declaring a named type with the same name as a module in scope is forbidden: that is, a type definition, trait, struct, enumeration, union, type parameter or crate can't shadow the name of a module in scope, or vice versa. Items brought into scope with use also have this restriction.\n\nRust needs to know the path of a function or module just like in Unix/Linux you can't call a bash script without specifying its path or editing the PATH variable so that the shell knows where to find the script you are calling.\nModule Tree Path\nA path can take two forms:\n\nAn absolute path starts from a crate root by using a crate name or a literal crate.\n\nA relative path starts from the current module and uses self, super, or an identifier in the current module.\n\n\nabsolute path\nYou can use the crate keyword in order to specify the absolute path for where a module lives.\nfn main() {\n    // relative path usage\n    let soldier = crate::military::Soldier::new(\"John Rambo\", 32, \"SFC\", 12);\n    assert_eq!(soldier.name, \"John Rambo\");\n    // assert_eq!(soldier.age, 32);\n}\n\nmod military {\n    #[allow(dead_code)]\n    pub struct Soldier {\n        pub name: String,\n        age: u32,\n        rank: String,\n        years_of_service: u32,\n    }\n    impl Soldier {\n        pub fn new(name: &str, age: u32, rank: &str, years_of_service: u32) -> Soldier {\n            Soldier {\n                name: String::from(name),\n                age: age,\n                rank: String::from(rank),\n                years_of_service: years_of_service,\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nabsolute path playground\nNotice that we used the crate keyword and then used called the military module. \nThis usage is known as using the absolute path.\nIn order for us to use the Soldier struct outside of the military module we neen to change its visibility to public.\nAdditionally each field that we want to use outside of the military module needs to be made public so that is why we added the pub access modifier to the name field in the Soldier struct.\nrelative path\nWe can also call modules and its items by using their relative path.\nLet us look at an example to further clarify this idea:\nfn main() {\n    let person = species::Human::new(\"John Rambo\", 32, \"Male\");\n    assert_eq!(person.name, \"John Rambo\");\n}\n\nmod species {\n    #[allow(dead_code)]\n    pub struct Human {\n        pub name: String,\n        age: u32,\n        gender: String,\n    }\n\n    impl Human {\n        pub fn new(name: &str, age: u32, gender: &str) -> Human {\n            Human {\n                name: String::from(name),\n                age: age,\n                gender: String::from(gender),\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that we called the method in the species module using relative path syntax.\nrelative path playground\nwhen to choose absolute or relative\nEach software project will need to decide whether to use absolute or relative.\nIf we go back to the previous example and moved species module to another module then the absolute path of the module will have changed but the relative path would still be the same.\nSo to clarify if we created another module in another module called animal_kingdom then the absolute path would be:\nanimal_kingdom::species::Human::new(\"John Rambo\", 32, \"Male\")\nwhile the relative path would still just be:\nspecies::Human::new(\"John Rambo\", 32, \"Male\")\nif we had a function in the same example like this:\nmod species {\n    #[allow(dead_code)]\n    pub struct Human {\n        pub name: String,\n        age: u32,\n        gender: String,\n    }\n\n    impl Human {\n        pub fn new(name: &str, age: u32, gender: &str) -> Human {\n            Human {\n                name: String::from(name),\n                age: age,\n                gender: String::from(gender),\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npub fn logging_example() {\n    crate::species::Human::new(\"John Rambo\", 32, \"Male\");\n}\n\nIf we were to move the logging_example function to another module then the absolute path new method call would stay the same but the relative path for the logging_example function would need to be updated.\nuse keyword\nThe use keyword is used to bring items into scope in rust\nLet us look at an example of the use keyword\nfn main() {\n    let pov = Truck::new(\"Ford\", \"F150\", 2019);\n    println!(\"{}\", pov.message());\n}\n\nuse vehicle::Truck;\n\nmod vehicle {\n    pub struct Truck {\n        make: String,\n        model: String,\n        year: u32,\n    }\n\n    impl Truck {\n        pub fn new(make: &str, model: &str, year: u32) -> Truck {\n            Truck {\n                make: String::from(make),\n                model: String::from(model),\n                year: year,\n            }\n        }\n\n        pub fn message(&self) -> String {\n            format!(\n                \"Make: {},\\nModel: {}\\nYear: {}\",\n                self.make,\n                self.model,\n                self.year,\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that we were able to call the Truck method and its methods without specifying the vehicle module.\nThis is because the use statement of use vehicle::Truck; brought the Truck struct into scope for the current module.\nuse keyword playground\nmodule separation\nModules can be separated into different files for further organization.\nWhen you use the ; (semicolon) instead of using a block statement then rust knows to lad teh contents of the module from another file with the sanme name as the module.\nmodule separation example\nThere is an example of this in the koans crate in the workshop if you look at:\nModules => pub mod usage;\nThe statement pub mod usage loads the content of usage\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Patterns\nStandard Library →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/standard_library.html":{"url":"docs/standard_library.html","title":"Standard Library","keywords":"","body":"Rust Workshop - Standard Library\nSections:\n\nRust Standard Library\nCommon Collections\nInput/Output (IO))\nMultithreading\nPrimitive Types\nThe Rust Prelude\nThreading\n\n\nCommon Collections\nVectors\nHash Maps\nStrings\n\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nRust Standard Library\nRust has a standard library much like other programming languages. \nFrom what I have learned Rust seems to follow the philosophy of C/C++ of maintaining a smaller standard library.\nRust does not proscribe to Python's Batteries included mentality for standard libraries.\nCommon Collections\nRust maintains a smaller standard library core and uses common collections such as:\n\nSequences:\nVectors\nVecDeque\nLinkedList\n\n\n\n\nMaps:\nHashMap\nBTreeMap\n\n\n\n\nSets:\nHashSet\nBTreeSet\n\n\n\n\nBinary Trees:\nBinary Heap\n\n\n\nInput/Output (IO)\nRust has a package called std::io for dealing with input and output.\nRust deals with common types of IO such as:\n\nio\ncommonly needed io operations module\nio\n\n\n\n\nfiles\nfilesystem module\nfs\n\n\n\n\nTCP/UDP Communication \nThis module provides networking functionality for the Transmission Control and User Datagram Protocols, as well as types for IP and socket addresses.\nnet\n\n\n\nMultithreading\nRust has a package for multithreading operations called std::thread\nPrimitive Types\nPrimitives in Standard Library\nThe Rust Prelude\nPrelude\n\nThe prelude is the list of things that Rust automatically imports into every Rust program.

By using the standard implementations, it should be possible for two libraries to communicate without significant data conversion.\n\nRust has collections types for Sequences, Maps, Sets and Binary Trees but for the most part you will only ever need to use Vectors => Vec and Maps => HashMaps.\nVectors\nVectors\nBy and large the Vec collection will be the collection type you use most often in rust and has many useful methods you can use.\nWe have already seen the Vec type throughout the workshop but haven't formally talked about them yet.\nA Vector is a resizable array and like slices their size cannot be known at compile time.\nVectors can grow and shrink at any time.\nA vector can be represented by 3 parameters:\n\nRepresent a pointer to data\nNumber of existing elements aka length\nAmount of space that is allocated that is allocated for future elements aka capacity\n\nCreate vector with new method\nYou can create a vector by calling the new method defined in the Vec struct\n// create a vector with new method\nlet numbers = Vec::new();\n\nCreate vector using vec! macro\nYou can also use the vec! macro that is defined in the standard library to create a new vector.\nThe vec! macro is defined like this in standard library:\n...................................\nmacro_rules! vec {\n    ($elem:expr; $n:expr) => (\n        $crate::vec::from_elem($elem, $n)\n    );\n    ($($x:expr),*) => (\n        ::into_vec(box [$($x),*])\n    );\n    ($($x:expr,)*) => ($crate::vec![$($x),*])\n}\n...................................\n\nBy using the vec! macros you can create a new vector using the array syntax that we previously used:\nfn main() {\n    let primes_array: [u32; 5] = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];\n\n    for prime in &primes_array {\n        println!(\"{}\", prime);\n    }\n\n    let primes_vec_macro = vec![2, 3, 5, 7, 11];\n    for (index, prime) in primes_vec_macro.iter().enumerate() {\n        assert_eq!(&primes_array[index], prime);\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that in the primes_array we created an array and specified the type and capacity, while in the primes_vec_macro we simply passed in the values and the vec! macro will infer the type and set a capacity for the vector for us.\narray and vector comparison playground\nVector methods\nVector Methods\nThere are many methods defined in the standard library but we will only go over some of them in this workshop. \nPlease read the standard library about them as you need them.\nWe already showed one of the methods earlier which was Vec::new() which was used to create a new empty Vec type.\nVec get method\nThe get method is much safer than accessing by index which can result in an out of bounds indexing panic during runtime.\nfn main() {\n    let primes_first_three = vec![2, 3, 5];\n\n    assert_eq!(primes_first_three[2], 5);\n\n    // assert_eq!(primes_first_three[4], 0);\n\n    assert_eq!(primes_first_three.get(4), None);\n}\n\nIf you were to uncomment the direct vector index it would be a runtime panic.\nThe get is much safer and you can check if a vector has a value without causing a runtime panic like this:\nif let None = primes_first_three.get(4) {\n    println!(\"{}\", \"Invalid index here!\");\n}\n\nVec::get() method playground\nvector used a stack\nYou can use Vec as an efficient stack as well by using the push() and pop() methods.\nRemember that a stack structure is much like a stack of plates when washing dishes. Each plate that you stack on top is pushed onto the stack and you don't remove plates from the bottom of the stack instead you pop a plate from the top. \nLikewise the push method pushes items to the end of the stack while the pop method removes elements from the top of the stack.\nVec::push method\nVec::push\nlet mut primes = Vec::new();\n\nprimes.push(2);\nprimes.push(3);\nprimes.push(5);\n\nlet five: usize = 5;\n\nassert_eq!(primes[primes.len() - 1], five);\n\nNotice here that we pushed => 2, 3, 5 onto the vector variable primes and that just like a stack the top of the item is the last item pushed which in this case is the 5 item.\nNotice that we also used the \nVec::pop method\nVec::pop\n.................................\nprimes.push(7);\nassert_eq!(primes.pop(), Some(7));\n\nNotice here that pushed 7 onto the stack and then when we called the pop method it gave us the item on the top of the stack which is 7. \nAlso note that the pop method returns Option type because it is possible that vector is empty in which case the None enum value is returned which represents no value.\nThis is why we asserted Some(7) instead of just 7.\nIterating through vectors\nRemember that iterators are used to traverse data structures like stacks.\nIterators will traditionally have next() method and you can read more about this pattern in the Iterator_Pattern wikipedia link.\nWe can iterate through the primes vector variable like this:\nlet mut primes = Vec::new();\n\nprimes.push(2);\nprimes.push(3);\nprimes.push(5);\nprimes.push(7);\nprimes.push(11);\n\n\nlet mut iterator = primes.iter();\nassert_eq!(iterator.next(), Some(&2));\nassert_eq!(iterator.next(), Some(&3));\nassert_eq!(iterator.next(), Some(&5));\nassert_eq!(iterator.next(), Some(&7));\nassert_eq!(iterator.next(), Some(&11));\n\nNotice here that we called the next method. The next method is a deref method and in rust it uses the Deref trait and traits will be introduced later in the workshop but know that this emulates inheritance in rust.\nWith that being said it is a method we can use with the vector.\nWe can also use call the enumerate method and get an index value and use a for loop with rust like this:\nlet primes2 = vec![2, 3, 5, 7, 11];\n\nfor (index, prime) in primes2.iter().enumerate() {\n    assert_eq!(&primes[index], prime);\n}\n\npush|pop|next|iter|enumerate playground\npush|pop|next|iter|enumerate playground\niter_mut method\nWe can also use the iter_mut method to return an iterator that allows us to modify each value in the Vec variable\nlet mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nfor number in numbers.iter_mut() {\n    *number *= 2;\n}\n\nlet factor_of_two = vec![2, 4, 6, 8, 10];\n\nfor (index, number) in numbers.iter().enumerate() {\n    assert_eq!(number, &factor_of_two[index]);\n}\n\nHash Maps\nThe HashMap module will not be used as often as the Vec Module but it is another important module to be aware of rust.\nYou will typically use the HashMap module when you are in need of Map data structure.\nThe HashMap module is the equivalent of what is known as associative arrays, maps, symbol table, or dictionary in other programming languages.\nA HashMap like a Vector is an abstract data type or in other words a data type that has a defined behavior which is implemented through methods.\nThis abstract data type (ADT) usually has the following methods in its API:\n\naddition of a pair to its collection\nput|insert|set\n\n\n\n\nremoval of a pair to its collection\ndelete|remove\n\n\n\n\nmodification of an existing pair\n\ninsert\n\n\nlookup of value that is associated with a particular key\n\nget\n\n\ncheck if it is empty\n\nis_empty|isEmpty\n\n\n\n\nthe number of entries aka size\nsize|len\n\n\n\n\na list of keys in the symbol table|map|dictionary\nkeys\n\n\n\nThe Rust API for HashMap has these methods and more already defined for us:\ninsert method\nThe insert method inserts a key:value pair into the map.\nThe insert method returns an Option type and so will return None if no key is present and will will return a Some Type and modify current value if it exists.\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut soldiers = HashMap::new();\n\n    #[derive(Debug, Clone)]\n    struct Soldier {\n        name: String,\n        age: u32,\n        rank: String,\n        years_of_service: u32,\n    }\n    let rambo = Soldier {\n        name: String::from(\"John Rambo\"),\n        age: 32,\n        rank: String::from(\"SFC\"),\n        years_of_service: 12,\n    };\n    soldiers.insert(\"rambo\", &rambo);\n\n    let chuck = Soldier {\n        name: String::from(\"Chuck Norris\"),\n        age: 34,\n        rank: String::from(\"MSGT\"),\n        years_of_service: 13,\n    };\n    soldiers.insert(\"chuck\", &chuck);\n\n    assert_eq!(soldiers.get(\"rambo\").unwrap().name, rambo.name);\n    assert_eq!(soldiers.get(\"chuck\").unwrap().name, chuck.name);\n\n    let mut junior = rambo.clone();\n    junior.name = String::from(\"Son Of Rambo\");\n\n    soldiers.insert(\"rambo\", &junior);\n    assert_eq!(soldiers.get(\"rambo\").unwrap().name, String::from(\"Son Of Rambo\"));\n    assert_eq!(soldiers.get(\"rambo\").unwrap().age, 32);\n}\n\nHere we inserted 2 entries into the soldiers HashMap and then used get to retrieve our key/value pair.\nNotice that we had to call unwrap as the call to get returns an Option value\nHashMap insert playground\nNotice that in the 2nd call to insert we set a name value and insert over\nremove method\nThe remove method will remove the key and will return the old value that was set for the key. \nOn any subsequent calls to remove, the None enum type will be returned.\n...............................................................\nassert_eq!(soldiers.remove(\"rambo\").unwrap().name, String::from(\"Son Of Rambo\"));\nassert_eq!(soldiers.remove(\"rambo\"), None);\n\nNotice that when we tried to call remove again we got the None type returned\nis_empty method\nThe is_empty method returns a boolean value\n...................................\nassert_eq!(soldiers.is_empty(), false);\n\nkeys method\nThe keys returns a list of keys in an arbitrary order.\nfor key in soldiers.keys() {\n    assert_eq!(*key, String::from(\"chuck\"));\n}\n\nHashMap playground example\nHashMap Playground\nStrings\nIn Rust there is 2 types of strings:\n\nString\n\nA String is stored as a vector of bytes (Vec), but guaranteed to always be a valid utf-8 sequence. \nString is heap allocated, growable and not null terminated.\n\n\n&str\n\n&str is a slice (&[u8]) that points to a valid utf-8 sequence.\nThe utf-8 sequence can be used to see the String.\n\n\n\nWe have already used both of these types of strings in the workshop but haven't formally talked about them in detail.\nstd::str module\nThe std::str module explains in detail Structs and function you can use.\nlet message = \"I am a message!\";\n\nThis is known as a String Literal or String Slice. \nString Literals have a static lifetime which means that the variable message has a value for as long as the duration of the running program.\nstd::string::String module\nWe have been using the String module methods all throughout the workshop\nWe have been using the String::from method for the most part like this:\nlet message = String::from(\"I am a message!\");\n\nThere are other ways to create a String type like this:\nlet message = \"I am a message!\".to_string();\nlet message: String = \"message here\".into();\n\nString concatenation\nWe can concatenate strings using the + but we must understand the borrowing rules at times.\nlet word = \"word\".to_string();\nlet up = word + \" up\";\nassert_eq!(up, String::from(\"word up\"));\n\nstd::str primitive type methods with string\nThere is methods available in the primitive type str that we can use \nfn main() {\n    let pangram: &'static str = \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\";\n    assert_eq!(pangram.len(), 43);\n    let mut pangram_reversed_list = \"dog lazy the over jumps fox brown quick the\".split_whitespace();\n    for word in pangram.split_whitespace().rev() {\n        assert_eq!(word, pangram_reversed_list.next().unwrap());\n    }\n}\n\nNotice here that we used the len method to compute the length and the split_whitespace primitive methods for the string slice.\nString module methods\nThere are several methods in the String module that you can use one of which is the \nString::new method.\nWe have already looked at the String::from method throughout the workshop.\nFinal Strings example\nfn main() {\n    let pangram: &'static str = \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\";\n    assert_eq!(pangram.len(), 43);\n    let mut pangram_reversed_list = \"dog lazy the over jumps fox brown quick the\".split_whitespace();\n    for word in pangram.split_whitespace().rev() {\n        assert_eq!(word, pangram_reversed_list.next().unwrap());\n    }\n    let alphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\n    let mut builder = String::new();\n    for ch in alphabet.split(\"\") {\n        builder.push_str(&(ch.to_owned() + \"|\"));\n    }\n    assert_eq!(builder, String::from(\"|a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z||\"));\n}\n\nString playground\nString playground\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Modules\nError Handling

unrecoverable state.\npanic! macro options\nHere is the rules to the macro:\nmacro_rules! panic {\n    () => { ... };\n    ($msg:expr) => { ... };\n    ($msg:expr,) => { ... };\n    ($fmt:expr, $($arg:tt)+) => { ... };\n}\n\nThe panic! macro is used in the unwrap method for the Option and Result enums.\nfn bad_number(n: u32) {\n    if n == 22 {\n        panic!(\"Who likes the number 22!\");\n    }\n    println!(\"{}\", \"Nice Number!\");\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    bad_number(18);\n    bad_number(22);\n}\n\npanic! macro playground\nOption enum\nThe Option enum represents an optional value with 2 states:\n\nSome\nNone\n\nfn input(phrase: Option) -> String {\n    match phrase {\n        Some(\"Workshopper\") => String::from(\"Hello There\"),\n        Some(l) => String::from(l),\n        None => String::from(\"\"),\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    assert_eq!(input(Some(\"Workshopper\")), \"Hello There\");\n    assert_eq!(input(None), \"\");\n    assert_eq!(input(Some(\"Yup\")), \"Yup\");\n}\n\nIn the program above we defined a function called input that takes an Option Enum as a parameter and uses pattern matching to return a string back to user.\nOption playground\n? operator\nWe can use the ? for error propagation in Rust.\nfn version(ph: Option) -> Option {\n    let guess_number: i32 = ph;\n    Some(guess_number * 5)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let sum = version(Some(5));\n    assert_eq!(sum.unwrap(), 25);\n\n    let problem = version(None);\n    assert_eq!(problem, None);\n}\n\nNotice that here we propagated the error by using ? in the program. simplying this program so we didn't need to use pattern matching.\n? playground\nFlow Control with Combinators\nThe concept of a combinator in Rust is closely tied to its definition in Haskell:\nCombinator Haskell\nwhich is a function or a definition with no free variables.\nIn Rust a combinator function will combine build some program parts from other program parts.\nCombinators can be used to manage control flow such as if you use the map combinator method that is defined in the Option enum.\nfn phrase(s: Option) -> Option {\n    s.map(|n| n.len())\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let count = phrase(Some(String::from(\"I am a phrase\")));\n    assert_eq!(count.unwrap(), 13);\n    let none = phrase(None);\n    assert_eq!(None, none);\n}\n\nNotice that here we use the map combinator method and it returns an option value and handles flow control for us.\nmap combinator playground\nResult enum\nThe Result enum is a type in Rust that represents Success => Ok or Failure => Err\nLet us look at some example to better explain this concept:\nfn dicey(d: Result) -> Option {\n    d.err()\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    assert_eq!(dicey(Err(\"What the dice!\")).unwrap(), \"What the dice!\");\n}\n\nIn this example we look at a function that takes a Result as a parameter and then calls the err method which returns an Option type.\nResult Playground\nBread Crumb

Generics\nSections:\n\nConcept of Generics\nGeneric Function\nImplementations\nTraits\nBounds\nWhere Clauses\nAssociated Items\nPhantom Types\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nConcept of Generics\nMuch like when you want to make a general analogy about a concept you can utilize Generics in Rust to generalize your Rust Programs.\nWe could specify a function and have functions that behave in the same exact way but that would be unnecessary if we can utilize generics.\nYou will typically see generics denoted by angle brackets and one letter Capitalized alphabet such as:\n => List of \n => List of \n\nGeneric Function\nA function can be considered generic if it is preceded by a  before its parameters specified in (...) and its name:\n// generic soldier\nstruct Soldier(T);\n\nfn i_am_generic(s: Soldier) {}\n\nHere we have a struct named Soldier that takes a generic of T and our function named i_am_generic takes a generic argument of T and specifies an argument of Soldier\nImplementations\nIn order for implementation to be generic the  must precede the type like this:\nstruct Student {\n    scores: &'a [T],\n    name: U,\n}\n\nimpl Student {\n    fn get_scores(&self) -> &[T] {\n        self.scores\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let student = Student {\n        scores: &vec![98, 99, 88, 85, 100],\n        name: String::from(\"Jean-Claude Van Damme\"),\n    };\n\n    let mut summation = 0;\n    for score in student.get_scores().iter() {\n        summation += score;\n    }\n    assert_eq!(summation / student.get_scores().len(), 94);\n    assert_eq!(student.name, String::from(\"Jean-Claude Van Damme\"));\n}\n\nNotice that here we have impl defined before the type declaration for the Student struct type.\nBounds\n\nTrait and lifetime bounds provide a way for generic items to restrict which types and lifetimes are used as their parameters. Bounds can be provided on any type in a where clause. There are also shorter forms for certain common cases:\n\nTrait Bounds specification\nTraits Recap\nWe previously mentioned Traits earlier in the workshop on the Data Types -> Trait Types Section so please check it out if you skipped to this section and do not know what a Trait is..\nstruct Number {\n    num1: i32,\n    num2: i32,\n}\n\ntrait Calculator {\n    fn adder(&self) -> i32;\n    fn subtracter(&self) -> i32;\n}\n\nimpl Calculator for Number {\n    fn adder(&self) -> i32 {\n        self.num1 + self.num2\n    }\n    fn subtracter(&self) -> i32 {\n        self.num1 - self.num2\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let number = Number {\n        num1: 5,\n        num2: 4,\n    };\n    assert_eq!(number.adder(), 9);\n    assert_eq!(number.subtracter(), 1);\n}\n\ntraits example recap playground\nBounds example\n#[derive(Debug,PartialEq)]\nstruct Army;\n\n#[allow(dead_code)]\n#[derive(Debug,PartialEq)]\nstruct Navy;\n\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nstruct AirForce;\n\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nstruct Marines;\n\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nstruct CoastGuard;\n\ntrait Service {}\n\nimpl Service for Army {}\n\nfn army(a: &T) -> &T {\n    a\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let soldier = Army;\n    // army is bound to Army and won't work with other services\n    assert_eq!(&Army, army(&soldier));\n}\n\nNotice that Service is bound to Army here and not to other services.\nBounds example\nWhere Clauses\nA Trait bound can be expressed using a where clause rather than at the Type Level .\nA where clause can apply Trait bounds to arbitrary types and not just type parameters.\nHere is how the where clause looks like in function:\n// Example of where clause with function\nfn func_thing(t: T, u: U) -> f32 \n    where T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug {\n\n    }\n\nHere is how the where clause looks like in implementation:\nuse std::fmt::Debug;\n\ntrait Dude {\n    fn he_who_abides(self) -> String;\n}\n\nimpl Dude for T where Option: Debug {\n    fn he_who_abides(self) -> String {\n        format!(\"{}\", self)\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let sentence = \"The rug really tied the room together\";\n    let big_lebowski_phrase = String::from(sentence);\n    assert_eq!(\n        big_lebowski_phrase.he_who_abides(),\n        sentence,\n    );\n}\n\nAssociated Items\nAssociated Types specification\n\nAssociated types are type aliases associated with another type. Associated types cannot be defined in inherent implementations nor can they be given a default implementation in traits.\nAn associated type definition defines a type alias on another type. It is written as type, then an identifier, then an =, and finally a type.\n\nAssociated Item example:\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nstruct ServiceMember {\n    branch: String,\n    name: String,\n    age:

for `num` starts here\n    {\n        let borrow_num = &num; // Lifetime for `borrow_num` start here\n        println!(\"borrow_num is {}\", borrow_num);\n    } // Lifetime for `borrow_num` ends here\n} // Lifetime for `num` ends here\n\nExplicit Lifetime Annotation\nThe notation to denote lifetimes in rust is apostrophe ', here is an example:\nDude\n\nLifetimes and Functions\nWe will talk later about elision :roll_eyes:\nFunction Signatures with Lifetime constraints:\n\nA reference must have an annotated lifetime\n\nfn main() {\n    let num: u32 = 5;\n    assert_eq!(*number(&num), 5);\n\n    print_num(&num);\n}\n\n// 'n has the same lifetime as the the returned reference\nfn number(num: &'n u32) -> &'n u32 {\n    num\n}\n\n// The input reference 'n lives as long as the function\nfn print_num(num: &'n u32) {\n    println!(\"num is {}\", num);\n}\n\nLifetimes and Methods\nThe lifetime annotation for methods is the same as for functions.\nstruct Soldier {\n    name: String,\n    age: u32,\n}\n\nimpl Soldier {\n    fn print_attrs(&'s self) -> String {\n        format!(\n            \"{}\\n{}\",\n            self.name,\n            self.age\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let rambo = Soldier {\n        name: String::from(\"John Rambo\"),\n        age: 32,\n    };\n    assert_eq!(rambo.print_attrs(), \"John Rambo\\n32\");\n}\n\nLifetimes and Structs\nLike methods the annotations for structs are the same\nstruct Unit(&'u f32);\n\nstruct Square {\n    length: &'l i32,\n    width: &'w i32,\n}\n\nimpl Square {\n    fn area(&'a self) -> i32 {\n        self.length * self.width\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let unit = Unit(&5.5);\n    assert_eq!(*unit.0, 5.5);\n\n    let sq = Square {\n        length: &5,\n        width: &4,\n    };\n    assert_eq!(sq.area(), 20);\n}\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Generics\nTesting

your code.\nThere are many types of testing that you can do and I wrote a workshop on it that you can explore here\nUnit Tests\nA unit tests will generally tests a unit of code such as a function or a series of functions.\nUnit tests are usually automated tests that test a unit of work such that it is behaving as intended.\nTesting is integrated in Rust so we can use easily unit test our source code.\nUnit tests in Rust are usually Rust functions that test the behavior of the code.\nWe have been making assertions of our source code throughout the workshop but have not formally talked about testing up until now.\nWhen you are writing unit tests in Rust you will typically place them in a module called tests and use the following attributes:\n\n#[cfg(test)]\n#[test]\n\nIn your unit tests you will usually make function/method calls for the unit under test.\nYou can use the following macros that exist in the Rust Standard Library for your unit tests:\n\nassert!\n\nAsserts that a boolean expression is true at runtime.\n\n\nassert_eq!\n\nAsserts that two expressions are equal to each other.\n\n\nassert_ne!\n\nAsserts that two expressions are not equal to each other.\n\n\n\nIf a particular unit test fails then you will receive a runtime panic.\nUnit Test Example\nLet us look at a Unit Test example to further solidify the concept:\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nfn average(numbers: Vec) -> f32 {\n    let mut sum: i32 = 0;\n    for n in numbers.iter() {\n        sum += n;\n    }\n    (sum / numbers.len() as i32) as f32\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::average;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_average() {\n        let actual = average(vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n        assert_eq!(actual, 3.0);\n    }\n}\n\n...........................................................................\n\nrunning 1 test\ntest tests::test_average ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out\n\n\nrunning 0 tests\n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out\n\nUnit Test Playground\nIntegration Tests\nAn integration tests is typically used to test a group of functionality and you will typically write an integration test after a unit test, although this is not a hard and fast either.\nAdditionally integration tests help test your public api and wouldn't test any private code you have.\nAn integration test will test that your code works correctly as a cohesive unit.\nOne thing of note is that you cannot group your integration tests in the same location as your unit tests.\nThe cargo package manager in Rust expects that your integration tests live in a folder called tests that is next to your src directory.\nLet us say that our average function lived in average/src/lib.rs in a crate called average like this:\nfn average(numbers: Vec) -> f32 {\n    let mut sum: i32 = 0;\n    for n in numbers.iter() {\n        sum += n;\n    }\n    (sum / numbers.len() as i32) as f32\n}\n\nWe will place our integration tests in a folder called tests next to the src folder inside of the average crate.\nOur integration test for the average public api would look like this:\nextern crate average;\n\n#[test]\nfn test_average() {\n    let actual = average::average(vec![5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);\n    assert_eq!(actual, 7.0);\n}\n\nNotice here that we explicitly declare extern crate average since our integration test does not about this function.\n\nAdmittedly this is not a very useful integration tests, this is mainly to demonstrate how you would setup and run an integration test.\nA more useful example of an integration test could be testing a restful api endpoint.\nUsing your integration test you could test that the route handler function is called and that any service functions related to this route are called.\nSo in this way you can test the behavior of groups of functions/methods by utilizing integration tests in Rust.\nDocumentation Tests\nRust provides an additional type of test called Documentation Tests.\nIn rust, the primary way of documenting a rust code base is through documentation comments.\nYou can also execute documentation tests using cargo test command.\nLet us write a documentation test for our average function:\n/// This function computes an average for a \n// vector of i32 data types.\n///\n/// # Examples\n/// \n/// ```rust\n/// let result = average::average(vec![1,2,3,4,5]);\n/// assert_eq!(result, 3.0);\n///\n\n[allow(dead_code)]\npub fn average(numbers: Vec) -> f32 {\n    let mut sum: i32 = 0;\n    for n in numbers.iter() {\n        sum += n;\n    }\n    (sum / numbers.len() as i32) as f32\n}\n\n![images/cargo-doc-test](../images/cargo-doc-test.png)\n\nNotice here that our `cargo test` run included line `Doc-tests` now.\n\nWe can also confirm that the document tests are running by making the doc test fail:\n\nIf we change our assertion to `assert_eq!(result, 4.0);`.\n\ndocument test fail:\n\n![images/cargo-doc-test-fail](../images/cargo-doc-test-fail.png)\n\nThe main goal around documentation tests is to provide examples that show the behavior of the code.\n\nRust strives to allow examples from documents to perform as complete code snippets.\n\nPlease read more this in the [api guidelines book](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html#examples-use--not-try-not-unwrap-c-question-mark)\n\n## Showing Test Output\n\nThe default behavior for the Rest test library is to captur anything that is printed to standard output.\n\nThis means that you won't be able to print any output to the screen unless your test fails.\n\nWe can utilize a command line argument to disable this behavior like this:\n\n```bash\ncargo test -- --nocapture\nSo if we updated our integration test example like this:\n#[test]\nfn test_average() {\n    let actual = average::average(vec![5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);\n    println!(\"actual is {}\", actual);\n    assert_eq!(actual, 7.0);\n}\n\nBy using the --nocapture flag we would be able to see standard output in the screen:\n\nFiltering Tests by Name\nBy Default when you run cargo test it will run any tests that it sees.\nIn order to filter out and run a single test you can pass the name of the unit test to run.\nLet us say that we have the following crate called filter-tests:\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nfn average(numbers: Vec) -> f32 {\n    let mut sum: i32 = 0;\n    for n in numbers.iter() {\n        sum += n;\n    }\n    (sum / numbers.len() as i32) as f32\n}\n\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nfn summation(numbers: Vec) -> i32 {\n    let mut sum: i32 = 0;\n    for n in numbers.iter() {\n        sum += n;\n    }\n    sum\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_average() {\n        let actual = average(vec![5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);\n        assert_eq!(actual, 7.0);\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_summation() {\n        let actual = summation(vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n        assert_eq!(actual, 15);\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that here we have 2 unit tests, one that tests the average function and another that tests the summation function.\nIf we wanted to just run the test_summation unit test we could do the following:\ncargo test test_summation\n\n\nIgnoring Tests\nYou can also ignore tests by using the #[ignore] attribute\n\nNotice that cargo reported that a test was ignored in yellow\nMiscellaneous Testing Topics\nThere is a multitude of testing subjects besides what I have covered here.\nOne great resource for general software testing is Martin Fowlers Testing Guide\nYou won't find any rust specific code whereas testing guidelines and concepts that can apply to any programming language.\nMocks and Stubs\nI don't have any specific advice on Mocks and Stubs to show as I still figuring it out.\nOne idea I have read through reddit posts is to use trait objects to facilitate generating test stubs with Rust.\nTest Fixtures\nYou can read this article on test fixtures\nProperty Based Testing\nI actually wrote a little bit about Property based testing in the Papers We Love RDU Chapter that you can check out Here\nPlease checkout this Wikipedia Link for more information\nTDD\nI would suggest reading Kent Becks book on Test-Driven Development for the best insight which you can find on amazon here\nI also did my humble attempt on explaining TDD on my software testing workshop\nThe examples are written in JavaScript but the one idea is the same.\nBDD\nThe cucumber documentation has one of the best overall explanation about Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) IMHO.\nCucumber Docs\nHow to Find me\nIf you like this free book on Rust then please consider
